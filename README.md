## Overview
This project is an attempt to create a Basic Python Interpreter that features basic python syntax but the keywords and data types will all be in Spanish.  

The inspiration behind this project came from a comment my brother made regarding the English Dominance of all programming languages. He questioned why all programming lanaguages were in english and that people from other countries were forced to learn English in order to learn to program. Since Python is a popular language and one of the most dominant programming languages I wanted to take on the challenge of creating a spanish version of the language. Unfortunately, due to the ever increasing complexity of CPython features and syntax, I will not be creating a full clone as that would take years to do on my own and the scale of complexity would be enormous. 

With that said, I welcome all contribution and maybe one day this project could grow alongside CPython with all of its features and syntax.

## Features and Functionality
This project will do its best to mimic [Python 3.0](https://docs.python.org/release/3.0/) and support limited features found in Python v3.0 documentation. Supported features will be documented as this software gets updated.
